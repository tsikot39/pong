# Pong Game

## Description

This is a classic Pong game implementation built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. It recreates the iconic 1972 arcade game where a player controls a paddle to bounce a ball back and forth against a computer opponent. The game features smooth animations, responsive controls, and an adaptive AI opponent that becomes more challenging as the game progresses.

## What It Does

The Pong game allows a single player to compete against an AI-controlled computer opponent in a fast-paced paddle ball game. The objective is to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle while defending your own side. The first player (human or computer) to reach 7 points wins the game.

### Key Gameplay Mechanics:
- **Player Control**: Mouse movement controls the bottom paddle
- **AI Opponent**: Computer-controlled top paddle with adaptive difficulty
- **Ball Physics**: Realistic ball movement with collision detection
- **Dynamic Speed**: Ball speed increases when hit by moving paddles
- **Score Tracking**: First to 7 points wins
- **Game Over Screen**: Shows winner and restart option

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies:
- **HTML5**: Basic structure and Canvas element
- **CSS3**: Styling, responsive design, and animations

## Game Controls

- **Mouse Movement**: Control the bottom paddle by moving your mouse left and right
- **Click "Play Again"**: Restart the game after it ends

## Game Rules

1. Use your mouse to control the bottom paddle
2. Keep the ball from passing your paddle
3. Try to make the ball pass the computer's paddle (top)
4. Each time the ball passes a paddle, the opponent scores a point
5. First player to reach 7 points wins the game
6. Ball speed increases when hit by a moving paddle
7. Ball trajectory changes based on where it hits the paddle
